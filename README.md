## _**App Ethos**_


The idea for **The Madrid Fan Zone** is a simple platform for Madristas (fans) to rate the overall performance of every Real Madrid player at the end of the 2022/2023 season.

 **The Madrid Fan Zone**  executes this by providing player statistics (goals, assists, clean sheets) and allowing users to interact by giving a personal review for each player on the team.

***
### _**CONCEPT**_

With Express, you can achieve most of these tasks by organizing your code into three main components: Models, Views, and Controllers.

Models: These represent the data structures of your application, such as use Madristas,Player Profiles, and Player Reviews. They define how the data is stored and accessed.

Views: These handle the presentation of your application's data. They generate the HTML pages that users see in their browsers, allowing them to view and interact with the information.

Controllers: These act as the intermediaries between the models and views. They receive requests from users, process the data, and determine what actions to take. For example, they handle requests for retrieving user information, adding a new review, or deleting a review.

By following this approach, you can leverage Express to handle the routing of requests (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) and easily manage the flow of data between Madristas, Player porfiles, and the Madrista Reviews.

User Authentication will be implemented using the Google OAuth framework. This means that users will be able to log in and access the application's features using their Google credentials. The Google OAuth process will handle the authentication and authorization aspects, ensuring secure and reliable user authentication within the application.

### _**Tools**_
- ExpressJS
-  Mongoose

- OAuth through Google
***
## _**Project Foundation**_

The overall Project will fall In line with the mongoose-movies exercise, I intend to incorporate a user-based rating system for the Player Profiles. This system will utilize a 1-5 rating scale to determine how good of a season each player had.

By utilizing EJS Partials, we can embed links at the top of each page to maintain a consistent and familiar layout as users navigate between the three branch directories:

**Players** (Index): This page will serve as the main directory listing all the players. The embedded links at the top will allow users to easily navigate to other sections.

**Player Profile**: This page will display detailed information about a specific player. The embedded links will remain consistent across all player profiles, ensuring easy navigation back to the Players Index or other sections.

**Social Media Handle**: This page will serve as a platform to showcase the social media handle for "The Madrid Zone." Madristas (fans) will have access to the latest transfer news, rumors, game day line-ups, statistics, and any other news related to anyone associated with the club.
By providing access to the social media handle on this page, Madristas will have a convenient way to stay informed and engaged with the latest news and updates regarding Real Madrid and its activities.
